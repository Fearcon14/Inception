# 'services' is the main section where we define each container of our application.
services:

# --- NGINX Service Definition ---
  # This name is also a DNS hostname on the internal network, so other containers can reach it at http://nginx.
  nginx:
    # 'build' tells Docker Compose to build an image from a Dockerfile instead of pulling a pre-made one.
    build: ./requirements/nginx

    # 'image' gives a name to the custom Docker image that will be built.
    image: nginx

    # 'container_name' sets a fixed, predictable name for the container when it runs.
    container_name: nginx

    # 'ports' maps a port from the host machine (your VM) to a port inside the container.
    # "443:443" means that traffic arriving at port 443 on your VM will be forwarded to port 443 in the NGINX container.
    # Port 443 is the standard for HTTPS traffic.
    ports:
      - "443:443"

    # 'volumes' links a directory on the host to a directory inside the container for data persistence and sharing.
    # 'wp_files:/var/www/html' mounts our 'wp_files' volume to the web root directory inside the NGINX container.
    # This gives NGINX access to the WordPress files to serve them to users.
    volumes:
      - wp_files:/var/www/html

    # 'networks' connects this service to a specific Docker network.
    # All services on the 'inception-network' can communicate with each other.
    networks:
      - inception-network

    # 'restart: always' is a policy that tells Docker to automatically restart this container if it ever stops or crashes.
    restart: always

    # 'depends_on' defines startup dependencies. This ensures that the 'wordpress' container is started before the 'nginx' container starts.
    depends_on:
      - wordpress

# --- WordPress Service Definition ---
  wordpress:
    # Build the image from the Dockerfile located in './requirements/wordpress'.
    build: ./requirements/wordpress
    image: wordpress
    container_name: wordpress

    # 'env_file' tells Docker Compose to load environment variables from the specified file.
    # This is how we securely pass database passwords and other secrets to the WordPress container without hardcoding them.
    env_file: .env

    # This is the key to sharing files. We mount the *same* 'wp_files' volume to the web root directory inside the WordPress container.
    # Now, both WordPress (which writes files) and NGINX (which reads files) have access to the exact same folder.
    volumes:
      - wp_files:/var/www/html
    networks:
      - inception-network
    restart: always
    # WordPress cannot function without its database, so we make sure the 'mariadb' service starts first.
    depends_on:
      - mariadb

# --- MariaDB Service Definition ---
  mariadb:
    build: ./requirements/mariadb
    image: mariadb
    container_name: mariadb
    env_file: .env

    # This is critical for data persistence. We mount the 'db_data' volume to '/var/lib/mysql', which is where MariaDB stores all its database files.
    # This ensures that your database data is safe even if the container is removed or recreated.
    volumes:
      - db_data:/var/lib/mysql
    networks:
      - inception-network
    restart: always

# --- Global Network Definition ---
# This top-level 'networks' key is where we define the networks that our services can use.
networks:
  # We are defining a network named 'inception-network'.
  inception-network:
    # 'driver: bridge' creates a standard, private network for the containers. Services on this network can communicate using their service names.
    driver: bridge

# --- Global Volume Definition ---
# This top-level 'volumes' key defines the volumes used for persistent data storage.
volumes:
  # We define the 'wp_files' volume.
  wp_files:
    # 'driver: local' means the volume data will be stored on the host machine.
    driver: local
    # 'driver_opts' allows us to provide specific options for the volume driver.
    driver_opts:
      type: 'none'
      o: 'bind'
      # 'device' specifies the exact path on the host machine where the data will be stored. This is a "bind mount".
      # IMPORTANT: This path must be absolute
      device: '/home/ksinn/data/wp_files'
  # We define the 'db_data' volume, which will also be a bind mount to a specific folder on the host.
  db_data:
    driver: local
    driver_opts:
      type: 'none'
      o: 'bind'
      device: '/home/ksinn/data/db_data'
